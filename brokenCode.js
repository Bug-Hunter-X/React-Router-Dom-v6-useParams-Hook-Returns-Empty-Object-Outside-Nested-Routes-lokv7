In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using the `useParams` hook within a component that's not directly nested within a route. This happens because `useParams` relies on the routing context provided by its parent route, and if it's accessed outside this context, it returns an empty object, leading to unexpected behavior, such as undefined values or rendering errors.  For instance, if you try to access parameters from a component deeply nested, but not directly under a route, you'll encounter this problem.
